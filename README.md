## ABOUT
My vision was to create an app that helps surfers get the most out of their adventures. An app that guides them to the perfect waves.

Every surf spot is unique, defined by its individual personality, its distinct features, and the often-hidden secrets that only the waves can tell. Throughout my surfing journeys, I realized the importance of having both treasured memories and up-to-date information at one's fingertips. That's why I developed this app: 

Experience the freedom of surfing like never before with „HIDDEN SURF SPOTS“ a central tool that not only serves as a faithful memory aid but also provides weather data. Store your own surf spots, Mark spots with useful information and be able to inform yourself about the conditions on site. This ensures that every surfer has all the relevant information about a spot immediately available, right when they need it most. Even if you haven't been to this place for a long time, you have access to your entered information anytime from anywhere.
